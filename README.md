## About This Project

This project is for those who don't understand math without a visual guide. I want to build a tool for using matplotlib to visualize mathematics in new way!

## Built With
* [java](https://www.java.com/en/)
* [javax.swing](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html)
* [Apache-POI](https://poi.apache.org/)

## How It Works


## Developed By

## About Me and Why I built this project

My name is Noah Caleanu and I have a strong interest in Python coding. I have developed software in Python for a couple years now and my favuorite things to make help improve the quality of life for people in some shape or form. I find myself thinking a lot about mathematics and how it isn't as difficult to understand as people think. I thought to myself that I could make Math Animations to deepen people's understanding and increase the chances of remembering. 

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the software up and running on your local machine.
### System Requirements / Prerequisites
MAC OS:
